# clickimage-generator (WIP)

The _clickimage-generator_ was developed as web application to easily create
click images. The WebApp is available under
https://elb-min-uhh.github.io/clickimage-generator/ and can be opened platform
independently in the most common browsers when cloning the repository.
The application outputs HTML source code for the
[clickimage.js](https://github.com/elb-min-uhh/clickimage.js).

## Usage

can add Pins using the _Add_ Button. The image is only loaded on your local
device and no data will be send to other servers.
